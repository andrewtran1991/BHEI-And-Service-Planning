By comparison, `r medicaid_cnty` of San Diego County residents were Medi-Cal insured, `r private_cnty` had private insurance, and `r uninsured_cnty` were uninsured. 
*	Housing:  `r renters` of renters in `r area_combined_lower` reported excessive cost burden for housing, defined as spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs. By comparison, `r renters_cnty` of renters in San Diego County reported excessive cost burden.

### Background and Methods
This report is generated by the Community Experience Project: Service Planning Tool, a custom application designed by UC San Diego in collaboration with County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services. The goals of the tool are to help ensure service provision is informed by data, based in cultural and regional considerations, and focused on communities that may be at greatest risk for unmet behavioral health need. This report summarizes the social, economic, housing, and demographic profiles of selected regions using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) for the 5-year period 2017-2021.

The following methodology is used to identify "Key Differences" in this report:
  
*	For each of the 50+ demographic, economic, and social indicators included in the report, the percentages are ranked by geography (i.e., subregional areas are ranked against subregional areas, zip codes are ranked against zip codes, etc.). A higher ranking corresponds to a higher percentage of residents who self-report each indicator or a higher ranking on the BHEI index and domains. 
  
* An area is included in the "Key Differences" section of the report if it meets the following criteria:  
    * the area has a ranking in the top or bottom 25% (i.e., top or bottom quartile)
    * the difference between the area estimate and the estimate for San Diego County is at least 5 percentage points, and  
    * there are at least four geographies available to rank
